## Delivery RAM account to other users {#section_sng_tzp_r2b .section}

**Note:** RAM users belong to a primary account. Thus, RAM users do not have resources and billing systems of their own. The operation cost of a DTplus RAM user is borne by the primary account. Fees incurred by operations of RAM users in Alibaba Cloud products are uniformly paid through the primary account to which these RAM users belong. Therefore, the primary account views the RAM user log on link and its own enterprise alias \(default domain\), and provide this information to a RAM user.

Log on to **RAM** \> **Overview**, and click **Update default domain** to change the enterprise alias \(default domain\).

When a RAM account is delivered to its users, you must provide the following details:

-   Logon link of RAM users.
-   Enterprise alias \(default domain\) of primary account.
-   User name and password of RAM users.
-   AccessKey ID and AccessKeySecret of a RAM user.
-   Confirm the primary account authorized your RAM user Enable Console Logon permission.
-   Confirm the primary account authorized your RAM user Manage AccessKeys permission.
